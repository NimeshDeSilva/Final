Instructions to run ruby program

1) Login to gl.umbc.edu
2) Linux should not be a problem because I checked linux1, linux2, and linux3 and they seem to all have ruby version 1.9.2
3) Just in case, check to see what version of ruby you're on, on the GL server. Enter in PuTTY or in terminal: ruby -v
4) Check the version of ruby for 1.9.2 or above
5) If it is not Ruby 1.9 or above then exit GL and login again with the following input in the next step
6) Terminal users: username@linux1.gl.umbc.edu
   PuTTY users: linux1@gl.umbc.edu 
7) Once in linux1.gl.umbc.edu, locate the directory where the files are located
8) Once in the correct directory run the following command to run the ruby files:
   Here is an example of running the ruby file for problem #1
      ruby problem1.rb
9) Now you're all set to grade my project

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Problem 1

ruby problem1.rb

In order to change the filename and integer you must access the file.
To access the file on an IDE just open problem1.rb in your IDE 
If you're editing the file on GL then enter the following command: emacs problem1.rb
Next you must locate fileName and numN towards the top of the ruby file
Then change fileName and numN to any text file and integer
Once done save and exit (Ctrl + X and Ctrl + Z if using GL)
Additionally check to see if the test file is in the same directory as problem1.rb
Next just run the file
